- 👋 Hi, I’m @AvgCliff89
- 👀 I’m interested in developing software -- in particular web applications.
-   Since my background is in accounting, I typically am a good fit for projects
-   maintaining and enhancing financial systems but that can be boring and would
-   be happy to get involved in more creative projects with a wide variety of uses.
- 🌱 I’m currently a student at Boston University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript or python projects.
- 📫 I can be reached at cliff@cliffcanaday.com 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
